  This tool wraps parsebarcodes.sh.

  We have observed occasional double ligation events on the 5’ end of Read1, and we have found
  that to fix this requires we run cutadapt twice.  Additionally, because two adapters are used for
  each library (to ensure proper balancing on the Illumina sequencer), two separate barcodes may
  be ligated to the same Read1 5’ end (often with 5’ truncations).  To fix this we split the barcodes
  up into 15bp chunks so that cutadapt is able to deconvolute barcode adapters properly (as by
  default it will not find adapters missing the first N bases of the adapter sequence)

  parsebarcodes.sh writes the following files:
  trimfirst_overlap_length.txt : file that always contains "1"
  trimagain_overlap_length.txt : file that contains max((length of longest barcode - 2),5)
  g_adapters_default.fasta : empty file (to be fed to cutadapt properly)
  a_adapters_default.fasta : empty file (to be fed to cutadapt properly)
  g_adapters.fasta :  fasta file containing sequences to be trimmed via cutadapt -g flag
  a_adapters.fasta : fasta file containing sequences to be trimmed via cutadapt -a flag
  A_adapters.fasta : fasta file containing sequences to be trimmed via cutadapt -A flag

    Usage: parsebarcodes.sh <randommer_length> <barcodes_fasta> <barcode_A> <barcode_B>
