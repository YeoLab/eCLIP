<!-- trackDb documentation Library
  In order to reference trackDb type and setting descriptions in multiple documents, this library
  file is designed to hold the one definitive copy of the setting or type description.

  ALWAYS VIEW trackDbTestBlurbs.html AFTER MODIFYING THIS FILE !!!!!!!

  How to add/maintain this documentation:
  There are 2 essential parts to trackDb*.html DOCS: I) this LIBRARY and II) the HTML PAGES.

  I) This LIBRARY consists of DIVs that contain "blurbs" describing settings and types.
     Example:
        <DIV class="someSetting"><span class="types bed bigBed"></span>
        <div class="format"><code>someSetting &lt;minVal&gt;</code></div>
            <P>Both <code>bed</code> and <code>bigBed</code> type tracks
            use <code>someSetting</code> in combination with
            <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">visibility</A> to accomplish something.</P>
            <P><B>Example:</B></P>
            <pre>   someSetting 100</pre>
        </DIV>
  - Each "blurb" DIV should have the class=<setting>.  There MUST be only one uniquely classed
    DIV for each setting or type.  NOTE: use class NOT id so that anchor links work.
    - Each "setting blurb" must contain a class="types..." SPAN that lists the track types that
      this blurb/setting is relevant to.
    - Each setting blurb MUST contain a class="format" DIV that gives the exact format of the
      setting, wrapped in <code> tags.
    - The setting blurb should also contain an <B>Example:</B> followed by a preferably real life
      example wrapped in <PRE> tags.  Remeber multi-line <PRE> text will include the indents
      found in this file!
    - Some settings may refer to other settings and your blurb should include a link to the other
      setting, especially if that setting's blurb will appear at some distance in the document.
      Since all settings should have an anchor by the setting name, a "jumpTo" link to
      visibility setting can be accomplished as:
          <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">visibility</A>
      which is identical to
          <A HREF="#visibility">visibility</A>
    - Any setting or code that is not made into a <A> link should be wrapped with <code> tags.
  - "Type setting blurbs" are the same as other setting blurbs except that there should be a
     seperate "example blurb" DIV with class of type_example (e.g. <DIV class="bed_example">).
    This will allow a type definition to be followed by multiple type specific settings then
    be completed by the example that references those settings.
    - These example blurbs should also have a "class=format" DIV but in this case it contains a
      title to the example:  <div class="format"><B>Examples of item base types</B></div>.
    - Exmples should make use of <PRE> tags and preferrably multiple real live examples.
  - Document introductions and section introductions may also be shared by multiple documents
    and therefore may be included here as "intro blurb" DIVs as: <DIV class="bed_intro">.
    - intro DIVs do not contain a class="format" DIV.
  - Use trackDbTestBurbs.html to test blurbs you add or modify.  It runs javascript tests.
  HINT: It is the class=<setting> that ties things togther.  If there is a need for multiple
  descriptions of the same setting, then create multiple blurb DIVs with different classes as:
    <DIV class="parent"> and and <DIV class="parent_view">.

  II) Document HTML PAGES should include this trackDbLibrary.html with server side includes
  and wrapped in <DIV ID="library"> tags.
  - Documents may differ, but using trackDbDoc.html as the quintisential example, the setting
    documentation is organized into tables by trackDb "type", so that settings are documented in
    the context of their use.  The (usually) single cell rows contain the settings.
    Settings table row example:
        <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD class="someSetting"><A name="someSetting"><IMG class='toggle detail'>
            <div class="format"><code>someSetting</code></div>
        </TD></TR>
    - Any setting may be referenced multiple times.  To reference a setting blurb, place it in
      a table cell that contains class=<setting> and an "image toggle details" tag.
      When the user clicks on the [+] button toggle image, the library will be read to render
      the <DIV class="<setting>">.
    - The table cell should also contain the "format" DIV, so the user knows what they are
      requesting.  The format containd in the doc will be replaced by the one in the
      library at toggle, so the library has the final word on format.  In the example,
      <code>someSetting</code> is replaced by <code>someSetting &lt;minVal&gt;</code>.
    - The first (or best) reference to your library blurb should contain the one and only
      "named anchor" for that setting <A name="<setting>">.  This named anchor MUST be at
      the beginning of the cell, before the toggle image. NOTE: the named anchor for a type is
      often put at the start of the table that describes it.
    - Related settings can be grouped as a set of related rows by adding the "related" class
      to the TR.  The first such related row must have class="related1st" as:
          <TR class="related1st" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="directUrl"> ...
          <TR class="related" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="hgsid">
      Related rows toggle as a set and have faint dividers between them.  The final setting DIV
      of a related set should have an example for the whole set.
  - Each table of settings for a particular type or set of types should end in an example. The
    Example cell behaves similarly to the setting cells, except the row has a special class:
        <TR class="examples" VALIGN=TOP><TD class="bed_example">
            <A name="bed_Examples"><IMG class='toggle detail'>
  - Each table should be headed with an introduction as:
        <THEAD><TR><TD><DIV ID="bed_intro" class="intro"></DIV></TD></TR></THEAD>
    All DIVs of class "intro" will be read from the library (by ID) and rendered when the
    page is first loaded.
  - Each table of settings can begin with a "toggle oneSection" image as:
      <TR VALIGN=TOP><TH><IMG class='toggle oneSection'> bed/bigBed - Item or region track settings
    This toggle will toggle all cells in the table.
  - The document as a whole should contain a "toggle all" image as:
        <IMG class='toggle all' />&nbsp;<I>Open/close all details.</I>
    which will open and close all the table cells.
  - The document should include a "self-assembling table of contents".  This is table will be
    built if
    - There is an empty table of ID="toc": <TABLE class="settingsTable" id="toc"></TABLE>
    - The $(document).ready() event calls: tdbDoc.tocAssemble(<delay>,[<exclude>]);
      - delay (ms) greater than zero will delay the start of the assembly for user responsiveness
      - <exclude> can be a comma separated list of settings (class=<setting>) to exclude
    - The table will fill in a header and a row per settingsTable td that contains a "format" div.
      The table will include 3 columns: setting, types that call it (from the "types" span) and
      the ID of the table that includes the setting.  Use this ID to be descriptive:
      ID="Signal_Track_Settings".
  Additional text, table of contents, etc. may best be built into the document, not the library.
  Please make use of "named anchors" and "jumpTo" anchors.  Add uniquely named anchors and directly
  reference those anchors as needed.

<H2>How to declare Dataset Display Settings
                                        in the Genome Browser</H2>
    <P>This document describes how to declare dataset display characteristics
    in the Genome Browser through trackDb settings.   Introducing new
    datasets for display in the Browser requires declaring the location
    and format of the data and defining initial display characteristics.
    In many cases, you may need to choose how the displayed data (aka
    "track") may be selected and configured.  These settings
    are declared in a simple text file format and stored in a database
    called the "track database",  or trackDb for short.</P>

    <P>The text file format
    for trackDb settings follow the simple "ra" rules which
    establish a "record" as a set of related settings in a
    "stanza" delimited by blank lines.  The first line of
    each stanza typically establishes the "key".  Each line
    in a stanza will contain a single word "setting" name and
    one or more words or numbers that follow are the setting's
    "value".   All trackDb stanzas are keyed by "track"
    and most will have certain common settings followed by track specific
    settings.  Here is an example:</P>

    <pre>
        track myFirstTrack
        type bed 6
        shortLabel Example Data
        longLabel The data in this track is format "bed 6".    </pre>

    <P>Every track should have
    these four settings.  The key of this track (<code>myFirstTrack</code>)
    is the name of the dataset.  If the data is loaded into a MySQL
    table then the track name is almost always the table name.  If the
    data is in one of the remote indexed file types (e.g. bigWig, bam,
    etc.)  then the name is typically the root file name.  However, this
    is a key to the track so it must be unique within the Genome Browser.
        (Data hubs need only declare track names unique to their hub.)
    After the "track" key, the most important setting for
    defining a track is the "type".  This tells the Browser
    which format the data is in, defines how to display it, and determines 
    which options are available for fine control of that display.

<DIV class="shortLabel"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>shortLabel</code></div>
    <P>Required: <span class="red">Yes</span></P>
    <P>Specifies the track's "short label", which is used in a
    number of places in the Browser to identify the track.  For
    example, the short label is displayed alongside the track in the Browser image.
    This label must be brief and
    is limited to 17 printable characters.</P>

    <P>Specifies the track's "long label", which is also used in
    numerous places in the Browser to identify a track.  For instance,
    the long label is displayed above the track's data in the Browser image.
    This label should be descriptive enough to
    allow users to uniquely identify the track within the Browser.  It

<DIV class="visibility"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>visibility</code></div>
    <P>Required: No</P>
    <P>Visibility (i.e. "display mode") specifies which of 5 modes (including 'hide')
    should be used to display the track within the Browser image.  This setting is
    almost always dynamically customizable by each user.  The exact configuration of the
    display for each mode depends upon the track's type, and some modes may not be supported
    for certain track types.  Be sure to experiment with this setting to verify that it works 
    as expected for your track type.</P>
    <P>Valid settings:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI><code>hide</code>: DEFAULT. The track is not displayed in the Browser image unless
    the user changes the display setting.</LI>
    <LI><code>dense</code>: The track is displayed as a single line or
    ribbon.  In many cases multiple items are summarized or drawn on top of
    one another, and the long labels are not displayed.</LI>
    <LI><code>squish</code>: Each item is drawn individually, but at half height
    and without a label.  <i>(Not supported for all types.)</i></LI>
    <LI><code>pack</code>: Items are displayed individually at full height, but
    in a much more compact vertical space than in full mode.
    <i>(Not supported for all types.)</i></LI>
    <LI><code>full</code>: Each item is displayed as a separate line in the
    Browser image.  Graphed signals may be displayed in varying heights.</LI>

<DIV class="html"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>html</code></div>
    <P>Required: No</P>
    <P>Specifies a file that contains the
    complete description of a track in HTML format.  The path of this
    file name is relative to the path of the trackDb file.  The
    ".html" suffix is implied.</P>
    <P>To be consisent with standard Genome Browser track descriptions, this description

    <P>Configuration controls can be placed inside a
    box on the configuration page.  This setting is decorative only,
    but can make a busy page look more cohesive.  Not all
    track types currently support this feature, but the most common types do, including

    <P>Most tracks can be displayed in all five
    visibilities modes.  However on some track types such as
    wiggles, the <code>squish</code> and <code>pack</code> modes offer no real advantage
    over the <code>dense</code> and <code>full</code> modes. By default, these tracks will
    not offer the <code>squish</code> and <code>pack</code> vilibility settings.
    Nevertheless, you can make your track offer
    these visibilility choices by turning canPack on.  Note: subtracks
    of composites will always offer all five choices.</P>

<DIV class="color"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>color &lt;red,green,blue&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Many track types allow the color of the data displayed in the image to be specified with 
    this setting.  The setting accepts
    red, green and blue values, each in the range of 0-255 and delimited by commas.  
    Though this setting is widely supported, some track types in certain display modes
    ignore it, such as the EST tracks in dense mode.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   color 255,0,0</pre>
    <P>This example sets the color to red.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="altColor"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>altColor &lt;red,green,blue&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Many track types allow setting a color range that varies from <code>color</code> to
    <code>altColor</code>.  For instance the CpG Island tracks use the <code>altColor</code>
    setting to display the weaker islands, while the stronger ones are rendered in
    <code>color</code>.  If <code>altColor</code> is not specified, the system will
    use a color halfway between that specified in the <code>color</code> tag
    and white instead.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   altColor 0,0,255</pre>

    <P>Most track displays that can be configured by a user can also be
    configured from directly within the
    Browser image through a right-click option that pops up
    a configuration dialog.  While this functionality works on the
    majority of track types, some configuration dialogs are too
    complex or have too much embedded javascript control to be reliably
    configured through a pop-up.  To turn off the ability to configure the track
    via right-click, change this setting to "off".  The user will still be able to
    configure the track on the track's configuration page. DEFAULT: on.</P>

    <P>Many tracks undergo multiple revisions over time.  In some cases,

    useful to declare the current version of the track.  Use
    this setting to display a version statement on the track

    practical or expedient. Therefore, the dataset may have its genome
    coordinates "lifted over" to the more recent assembly.

    short label in the track groups section below the Browser image, and on the track's 
    description and configuration pages.
    This setting has three parts:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI>icon -  Currently must refer to an icon in the Browser's images directory in the

<DIV class="priority"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>priority &lt;float&gt;</code></div>
    <P>The priority is used to define the order of a track within its track group or 
    data hub, as well as its default order within the Browser image.  
    The order within the image can be dynamically changed by the user and
    will always depend upon which other tracks are currently visible.
    Typically the priority is set only for tracks that are on by default in order to move them 
    ahead of other tracks. 
    Prioritized tracks within a group or data hub are displayed in ascending priority order, 
    followed by unprioritized tracks sorted alphabetically by short label. Tracks of the same 
    priority within a group or hub are sorted by short label.  
    Priority is a floating point number. Default: 0.</P>

<div class="format"><code>table &lt;tableName&gt;</code></div>
    <P><I>NOT FOR HUBS.</I></P>
    <P>The track setting of most tracks is the same as
    the table name. However, in some cases it is desirable to
    reference the same table in more than one track.
    An example of this is showing a table as a single signal track and
    as part of a combination overlay track, as described later in this
    document.  For data contained in MySQL tables, this setting must be used
    if the <code>track</code> setting is not the name of the table.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    track mySecondTrack
    table myFirstTable    </pre>

<DIV class="tableBrowser"><span class="types all"></span>
<div class="format"><code>tableBrowser &lt;off/on&gt; [table1 ...]</code></div>
    <P><I>NOT FOR HUBS.</I></P>
    <P>The Table Browser typically allows querying and downloading of some or all 
    of the raw data for a track. This setting can be used to block Table Browser access to datasets 
    with restrictions (for example, those with confidentiality or licensing limitations).  
    By naming additional tables in this setting, access to those 
    tables can be denied as well.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   tableBrowser off decipherRaw knownToDecipher</pre>
    <P>The table for this track, as well as the decipherRaw and knownToDecipher tables,

    <code>idInUrlSql &lt;sql for id&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Many tracks allow an external link when an
    individual track data item is examined.  Use this setting to put a
    link to an external URL on the details page.  The url may include
    wildcards that will be substituted with values from the track data
    or other Browser variables:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI>$$ - ID, will be replaced by the <code>name</code>
    of an item or other string id depending upon the fields in the

    </UL>
    <P>Note that url2 is also supported for a second
    external link.
    </P>
    <P>For local (non-hub) tracks, an additional setting can be used to find an ID
    from another table based upon the item name or id from the track's
    table.  The value found will replace the "<code>$$</code>" token in the <code>url</code>.
        Note that the format of this trackDb setting is a normal C
    language format so that the item will replace the "%s"
    token in the sql statement.</P>
    <!-- DONNA - I don't quite understand the idInUrlSql usage 
    TIM responds: By default the ID is the bed column 'name'.  That is what the $$ token
    gets replaced with in the url provided.  The idUnUrlSql allows having a separate table
    in the mysql database that holds an alternate id.  No doubt this setting was for a 
    special case added by one engineer for one specific result.  Nevertheless, it is now one 
    of our many settings I needed to document.  So if a wrangler has a case where the 
    'name' in their bed table can be used to look up a different name in a different table, 
    AND that different name is what they need use as an id in their url, THEN this is 
    the obscure setting for them. -->

    this association, the feature must have the same name in each genome, and the name 
    must be unique within the bed track of each genome.  The components of this

    with a label for the link.  If the column parameter is omitted, it is

    <P>A number of
    numerical filters are available for bed tracks.  These are
    conveniently named by the field that is filtered on.  The most
    common numerical filter is based on the standard bed field
    <code>score</code>, and is thus controlled by the <code>scoreFilter</code>
    setting.  Other examples are pValueFilter, qValueFilter and
    signalFilter, which are filters on non-standard bed fields defined
    in the broadPeak and narrowPeak formats.  These numerical filter
    settings should include the default value.  If the numeric field
    is floating point, the default should contain at least one decimal
    place.
    </P>
    <P>By default the range
    of values for a numeric filter is 0 to 1000.  However, you
    can explicitly set the upper and lower limits of the filter by
    setting <code>&lt;column&gt;FilterLimits</code>.
    </P>
    <P>The numeric filters
    will exclude items that fall below the setting. That is, a
    scoreFilter of 800 will  exclude all items with a score below 800.
    You can also filter for values within a range, by including the
    <code>&lt;column&gt;FilterByRange</code> setting.  For example, a 
    <code>scoreFilter</code> range of

    <LI> Each field/option pair is joined by '<code>=</code>' (equal sign).</LI>
    <LI> The field portion
    can have a title that is delimited from the field name by '<code>:</code> (colon)'.</LI>
    <LI> A single field

    <LI> If the options are
    a 1-based index (1,2,3...) then the option list can be preceded
    with a '<code>+</code>' (plus sign) and the options themselves are only labels.</LI>
    <LI> Otherwise, each
    option will be a value and optional label delimited by '<code>|</code>' (vertical bar).
    Note that if one option has a label then all options of that filter

    <div class="hintBox">
        <I class="red">Secret tricks:</I>
        <OL>
        <LI>Avoid the use of the delimiter chars <code> ,|:={}</code> in titles and
        labels.  (These characters can be included via HTML codes.)  
        Spaces can be included by using the '<code>_</code>' character.</LI>
        <LI>The option labels
        can be in color or have other CSS style attributes. Append the style 
        enclosed in curly brackets and containing no spaces. For example:
        <code>Pull_Over{color:#AA0000;text-decoration:blink;}</code>.
        If one option has CSS style, then all options of that
        filter must include a style definition.</LI>
        <LI>The filterBy option is implemented in the code using an SQL <code>where</code> clause.
        For instance, filtering on the <code>name</code> field for "Fred" and
        "Ethyl" would result in an SQL where clause of
        "<code>where name in ('Fred','Ethyl')</code>".  In <code>type genePred</code>
        tracks, this knowledge is used to define filters on fields in a separate table!
        This is done by defining the field as <code>{otherTableName}.{fieldName}</code>.</LI>
        </OL>
    </div>
    <P>The best way to
    understand this setting is with an example.  This is an operational
    example in the hg19 "Open Chrom Synth" track.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    filterBy color:Validation_Level=\
             0|Validated_(OC_1){color:#000000},\
             255|Open_Chromatin_(OC_2-3){color:#0000FF},\
             39168|DNase_low_(OC_2){color:#009900},\
             10027008|FAIRE_low_(OC_3){color:#990000},\
             16711935|ChIP-seq_(OC_4){color:#FF00FF} \

             Three&amp;#58;_FAIRE_(all),\
             Four&amp;#58;_ChIP_(all)    </pre>
    <P>This setting sets up
    two filters, one on the field "<code>color</code>" and a second for the
    "<code>ocCode</code>" field.  The color filter is given the title "Validation
    Level".  The second option has a value of "255" and a label
    of "Open Chromatin (OC 2-3)".  Note that it will appear
    as blue in the list due to the {color:#0000FF} style definition.
    Also notice that all options for this color field have a style
    defined, even though the first option is black and would be so by
    default. In this example, the only
    whitespace within the setting value section immediately precedes the second filter
    definition.  The second filter, "<code>ocCode</code>", is titled by the
    inscrutable "OC Code".  It is a numeric index filter
    (as declared by the '<code>+</code>').  The value of the second option is 2 and
    only the label gets defined as "Two: Dnase (all)".  Note
    that the colon in the label is an HTML code.
    </P>
    <P>The filterBy setting is very powerful. We recommend that you experiment with the
    settings to determine which work best for your case.</P>

    Depending on the current visibility of the
    bed track and which other tracks are being shown concurrently, the
    Browser may automatically reduce the display to pack or dense mode.  This setting
    allows you to force the data summarization at whatever display limit you consider
    reasonable. Unlike the <code>maxItems</code> setting, which controls the display of
    vertical space, this setting dictates the number of bases to be displayed horizontally 
    in a window before the track is forced into dense mode.  There is no default for this 
    setting, but the <code>maxItems</code> setting will ultimately prevent too many items from
    being displayed.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>

    <P><B>Example:</B></P>

    <P>The bedGraph type
    track has the same file format as a bed file, but is loaded into
    the MySQL database in a form that can be graphed.  By default the
    value to be graphed is the fifth standard bed field,
    <code>score</code>;  however, you can specify a different field to use.
    Typically only the first 3 standard bed fields are included
    (<code>chrom</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>) and the fourth field
    contains the signal value.  The bedGraph track offers
    a couple of important improvements over the wig track.  In wig
    tracks, the value of the signal is truncated into a single byte,
    which is effective for graphing but fails at data storage.  Also
    the wig type was originally designed for fixed-size windowing, though
    variations were added.  The bedGraph type allows for variable
    windowing and defining values even down to the base level.  To be
    clear, bigWig tracks are as versatile as bedGraphs.  It is
    only the wig format that suffers from these limitations.</P>

    <P>On the other hand the storage density of wig, particularly the fixed step
    variant, is vastly denser than bedGraph. In cases where the data is solely
    meant for display, the 256 levels supported by wig more than suffice.  For
    single-base or even 10-base level resolutions, bedGraph is generally not practical
    genome-wide.  Note also that wigs converted to bigWigs do not suffer the reduced
    precision of wigs loaded directly into the database.   A bigWig based on fixedStep
    wigs is the best way to represent dense graphs over the genome.</P>

    <P>Note that the lower and upper limits of the bedGraph signal are not declared in the type, 
    but rather are declared with 2 separate settings, <code>minLimit</code> and
    <code>maxLimit</code>.

    in autoScale which will ensure that the high score in the current

    this is configurable by the user.  Setting it to "<code>on</code>" in trackDb will default 
    the track to <code>autoScale</code>. Default: off.</P>
    <P>NOTE: this option

<div class="format"><code>windowingFunction  &lt;mean/mean+whiskers/maximum/minimum&gt;</code></div>
    <P>Depending upon how large of a genomic region
    is displayed in the Browser image, it may be necessary to summarize
    the actual signal.  This user-configurable setting controls how the Browser 
    collapses the signal from (for example) 100 or 100 thousand bases down to
    a single pixel.  By default
    the single pixel represents the <code>mean</code> of the data, though the
    <code>maximum</code> or <code>minimum</code> can alternatively be displayed.  A more informative
    option is often <code>mean+whiskers</code>.  This setting displays the
    mean, max and one standard deviation above mean, differentiated by shading. 
    The mean is displayed as the darkest shade, one stdDev above mean as 
    slightly lighter, and the max as the lightest shade.
    This subtle shading can quickly indicate if the
    condensed data is hiding important information that can 
    be adequately evaluated only by zooming in.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>   windowingFunction mean+whiskers</pre>

    <code>yLineOnOff &lt;off/on&gt;</code><BR>
    <code>gridDefault   on</code></div>
    <P>It can be useful to
    draw a line across the track's signal graph at some fixed y
    coordinate.  Do this by setting <code>yLineOnOff</code> to "on" and specifying the
    y coordinate with <code>yLineMark</code>.  These two settings are
    configurable by the user. Defaults: off and 0.0.</P>
    <P>Often confused with
    these configurable settings is the <code>gridDefault</code>, which simply draws a
    a line at y=0 across your entire track.  This setting might be
    useful if the lack of data is equivalent to a 0 signal.</P>
    <P><B>Example:</B></P>
    <pre>
    yLineOnOff on
    yLineMark 2.5
    gridDefault on    </pre>
    <P>The signal is graphed with a default solid line
    at zero, suggesting that any gaps in data should be interpreted as

    as <code>genePred</code> type does.  But if you understand the CGI code that

    <P>When gene models are
    selected from the genePred table for display in the Browser,
    their class is also selected from the "rnaTypes" table.  Using the
    <code>filterBy</code> setting creates a user selectable drop-down list box of
    3 choices or "all".  When the user filters by tRNA and snRNA (the
    green and blue choices), the mySQL select statement used by the

<H3>bam: Compressed Sequence Alignment/Map tracks</H3>
    <P>The bam format is an
    indexed compressed data format for sequence alignments.  It is ideal
    for remote access of high-throughput sequence tags and is a native
    output format for some high-throughput sequencing (HTS) aligners.
    The format of bam data is data-file pairs, with an index in a separate file.
    These are frequently remote datasets, not residing on the UCSC server.  Please refer to
    the <A HREF="../bam.html">BAM track format page</A>
    and the <A HREF="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/" TARGET=_blank>SAMtools website</A>
    for information on how to create and deploy these remote data files

    setting is included, that data at the location specified by that URL will be
    displayed. Otherwise, a database table with a single column <code>fileName</code>
    can specify the location of a local file or a URL.
    If the database table includes a column <code>seqName</code>, a different

    user-configurable.</P>
    <P>Possible settings:</P>
    <UL>
    <LI><code>strand</code>: (Default) When colored by strand, mismatched bases are highlighted in
    <B style="color:#FF0000;">bright red</B>, alignments on the reverse strand are
    colored <B style="color:#880000;">dark red</B>, and alignments on the forward strand are
    colored <B style="color:#000088;">dark blue</B>.</LI>
    <LI><code>gray</code>: When colored in grayscale, items are shaded according to the 
    method specified by <code>bamGrayMode</code>: alignment quality, base qualities, or unpaired
    ends.</LI>
    <LI><code>tag</code>: Colors are specified in "user-defined tags". SAM/BAM may
    include user-defined tags, the names of which begin with X, Y or Z and include one other letter
    or number. The user-defined tag named here specifies red, green and blue (RGB) intensities
    as a zero-terminated string (tag type Z) containing comma-separated triples of numbers
    from 0-255. For example, if a SAM/BAM record includes the tag YC:Z:255,0,0, then the
    item is colored red; YC:Z:0,0,255 makes the item blue. By default, the tag is "YC" unless
    changed using the <code>bamColorTag</code> setting.</LI>
<!-- DONNA - don't understand what he means by "tag named here". TIM answers: I welcome a rewrite 
    here.  In this section "tag" is being used in 2 ways. Sequence "tags" are the bam "items" 
    (akin to bed items).  But "bamColorMode tag" refers to special "tags imbedded in the bam 
    data file.  In both cases I was using the terminology of the art.  High-throughput 
    sequencing often refers to sequence tags as the short stretches of 20-100bp that are 
    aligned to the reference genome.  But the "YC" style codes imbedded in the bam file are 
    also referred to as tags by bam documentation.  Honestly I do not know much about these

<H3>chain and netAlign: paired species alignments</H3>
    <P><I>NOT FOR HUBS.  Nor are any of the settings in this section.</I></P>
    <P>While "<code>chain</code>" and
    "<code>netAlign</code>" formats are different, they often are paired to show two
    different views of the same data.
    </P>
    <P>Chain tracks show
    alignments of a "query" species to a "target" genome assembly.  For
    example, a chimp panTro2 can be aligned to the human hg19 genome.
    The chain format allows for gaps in both sequences simultaneously.
    When chains are viewed in the Browser, they show solid boxes for
    alignments, separated by either single or double lines.  The single
    lines appear when an insertion occurs in the target or a deletion
    occurs in the querying species.  Double lines represent gaps in both
    species that could result from a number of causes (e.g. an inversion
    in one species).  For more information on the "chain" format, please
    refer to <A HREF="../chain.html">
    http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/chain.html</A>.</P>
    <P>A netAlign track
    represents the best chain for each region in the target genome.  The net
    track will show the largest, highest scoring chains that span a
    region.  When these chains have gaps, they may be filled in
    with additional chains, shown at a lower level, and gaps in these
    chains may in turn be filled at an even lower level.  These levels
    help in visualizing genome rearrangements such as inversions and
    retroposed elements.    For more information on the netAlign
    format, please refer to

    <P>Though
    many microarray experiments have been superseded by high-throughput
    sequencing (e.g., ChIP-seq) experiments, several microarray tracks
    still exist.  Further, microarray experiments can be the economical
    or practical choice in many instances. The datasets for the built-in
    microarray tracks in the Genome Browser are stored in bed 12+3 (bed
    15) format that includes three additional fields: expCount, expIds,
    and expScores. To display correctly in the Genome Browser,
    microarray tracks require the setting of several attributes in the
    trackDb file associated with the track's genome assembly. Each
    microarray track set must also have an associated
    microarrayGroups.ra configuration file that contains additional
    information about the data in each of the arrays. Please refer to the
    <A HREF="http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Microarray_track">microarray track</A>

    for information on how to prepare microarray tracks.  In particular,
    that document describes the format of the groupings.ra file that

    "item" based track of "<code>bed 15</code>" format, the same format
    used for type <code>expRatio</code>.  Its purpose is to
    display transcription factors as detected in multiple cell lines,
    though it might be adaptable for any type of item that piles up
    into overlapping locations and will belong to one of several
    categories.  However, this type was specifically designed for
    combining transcription factor (TF) binding evidence from multiple
    cell lines into a single track.  As a bed type track, it consists of
    items or regions where there is evidence of TF binding. To the left
    of each item, the factor name is displayed, while to the right a
    coded list of cell types where the evidence has been found is
    displayed.  Unlike most item-based tracks, a second table is required
    to describe the cell lines.  Use the program hgBedsToBedExp to create

    subtracks based on specific cell types and antibodies to display in the Browser.  Up to 9
    subgroup types can be defined for a composite.  However, to minimize the complexity,
    it is strongly recommended that only two subgroups be defined
    for a given composite track. These will be presented in a simple X/Y matrix that is easy for
    the user to understand and navigate. It is possible to define more subgroups in additional

    Instead, it is recommended that you organize "abc"
    dimensions as drop-down multi-selects, often referred to as
    "filter" boxes due to their similarity to the
    <code>filterBy</code> setting discussed

    matrix, but are restricted to the "abc" dimensions.</P>
    <P>By default, the filter box for selecting
    subtracks is multi-select, meaning more than one choice is
    allowed.  It is possible to restrict this to a single choice by
    adding the "<code>=one</code>" option to the filter box definition.
    This might make sense when there are only 2 choices.  The choice

    <P>In ENCODE, subgroups

    stored as an ra file.  In this situation, the labels of these
    terms, as they are displayed in the track configuration page, can
    be linked to the controlled vocabulary definitions.  These links
    can be quite useful, as the term definition may include protocol
    documents and validation evidence.  In order to establish the
    links, each subGroup's tag must be tied to the actual metaDb
    term.

    <P>When declaring subgroups, it is often useful to
    sort the subtrack list by those subgroups.  By including a
    sortOrder setting, long sets of subtracks are more easily
    organized and navigated by the user.  If there are only a few
    subtracks in the composite, sorting may be of little value and 
    <A onclick="return jumpTo(this);" HREF="#">dragAndDrop</a> may be a better option.
    Currently only subgroups can be defined in the sortOrder, but it

    <P>Some composite track sets have their own
    directories of downloadable files and a special CGI for accessing
    those files.  In order to see the CGI interface for the download
    directory, the composite needs an object for each file defined in
    the metaDb.  The trackDb stanza for the composite also needs to
    have the fileSortOrder setting defined.  The setting is defined as
    a set of variable=value pairs, which defines the default sort
    order on metaDb variables.  The "var" portion of the each pair is
    a term defined in the metaDb for all of the file objects in the
    directory.  The "var" may also be "<code>fileType</code>" or "<code>fileSize</code>",
    which are not defined in the metaDb. The "val" is the title that the
    user will see as the column header for the sortable table of
    files.  This value can contain and '<code>_</code>' for spaces and limited HTML
        codes and special characters.  As always, you are encouraged to
    experiment.  The '<code>\</code>' continuation character should be used to
    break up this long setting into readable lines.

    participate in the default sort order, and the treatment subgroup is 
    sorted in reverse order by default.  The "None" treatment
    sorts before all others (in reverse order) by beginning the tag with
    a "Z".  Note that for this "A" dimension,
    the "None" treatment will be selected by default.  By
    declaring the proper settings, using subGroups to organize a
    composite can be quite powerful.</P>

    <P>This example illustrates that
    subgroups, dimensions, and (in the case of ENCODE) controlled vocabulary and
    metadata all must be linked together for the composite to fully
    work.  Further, the actual terms, programmatic "tags"
    and user visible titles all have different constraints and roles
    to play in establishing this cohesion.  Subgroup tags are used to
    organize subtracks, while lettered dimensions organize the
    configuration page to more easily select subgroups of subtracks.
    For ENCODE tracks, the subgroups may be represented as metadata
    "terms" (distinct from tags) that are often carefully
    defined by a controlled vocabulary.  In the example above, the tag
    "ab" is used to organize subtracks into subgroups but
    is also tied to dimension X.  This ensures that antibodies will
    appear as the horizontal dimension in the 2D matrix on the
    configuration page, and the selection of an antibody will select the
    associated subtracks.  Of course the user does not see the
    antibody as "ab" but "Antibody".  Going
    further, the term as defined in controlled vocabulary is
    "antibody", so that for all the tables and files
    associated with this composite track, their metaDb objects should
    contain an "antibody" var and a given antibody (e.g.
    H3K4me3) will be found in the controlled vocabulary with a
    validation document.  All the relationships can be confusing, but
    the trackDb settings, if done correctly, can tie all these
    elements together in a nice cohesive package.</P>

<!-- - - - - - - - VIEW settings - - - - - - - -->
<DIV class="view_intro">
<H3>Views</H3>
    <P>In addition to subgroups, a single
    composite can be divided into multiple "views".  Recall
    that a composite should be made up of subtracks of the same <code>type</code>.
    However, different types of subtracks can be combined into the same
    composite track if they are in separate  "views".  While
    views are like subgroups in many ways, they can carry their own
    settings.  This is necessary because the views within a composite may be for different
    types that have their own distinct configuration settings, for example bigBeds and
    bigWigs. </P>
    <P>The "view" (or
    "multi-view") organization is typically used when the
    same basic data is stored in multiple formats and granularities.  For
    example, a collection of views may include short read sequence alignments (type bam), signals
    representing pile-ups of aligned reads (type bigWig), and the  peaks (type
    bigBed) that are called in regions where  the evidence of experimental result is
    deemed significant.  These three "views" of the same
    experimental data can be seen more informatively as a cohesive set
    within a multi-view composite track.</P>
    <P>Views are declared both
    as a subgroup and as a separate track stanza.  A composite with
    multiple views has only views as children, and each view will have one
    or more subtracks as children.  The three levels must be defined
    together with indenting to make the hierarchy obvious.</P>
    
    <P id='inheritance'><div class="hintBox"><I><U>A note about
    inheritance.</U></I> Subtracks
    will inherit settings from their parents (both from composites and
    from views).  This is true when the setting is inheritable, which is generally
    the case.  Obvious exceptions are settings that are
    relevant only to the higher level.  Inheritance follows the "closest
    to home" paradigm in which a setting at the subtrack level
    takes precedence, followed by the view level setting, and finally 
    the composite level setting.  This inheritance applies to both the trackDb default settings 
    and the choices made by a user. Settings made 
    by the user involve a timing element as well:  a change to 
    a parent-level setting will override all settings of
    the same type for its children.  If the user subsequently makes a subtrack
    setting, it will override the inherited setting for that one
    subtrack.<BR><BR>
    An anomaly within the inheritance scheme is the "<code>visiblity</code>" (display mode) 
    setting.  Unlike other settings, visibility is cumulatively restrictive from the
    supertrack level.  That is, if the parent has a visibility of  "<code>dense</code>" and the 
    child's visibility is
    "<code>pack</code>", the child will be displayed as "<code>dense</code>". If the parent is
    subsequently changed to "<code>full</code>" display mode, the child will now be shown in 
    "<code>pack</code>" mode.  At the trackDb
    level, default visibility is always cumulatively restrictive.
    However, when a user explicitly changes a subtrack visibility to be
    greater than what was inherited from parents, that subtrack's
    visibility will override the inheritance.  While the subtleties of
    inheritance can be hard to explain, they are often intuitive in
    practice.</div></P>

    too cluttered.  The user must first open the box before its
    contents are seen.  If there is only one view with configuration

    Finally individual subtracks are configurable by default
    if their track type supports it.  Sometimes it is desirable
    to turn off configuration.  Configuration may be turned back
    on when it has been turned off at a higher level. For example, this might be
    useful in a situation with a multi-view composite where the composite
    level would normally be configurable, but you want only one of the
    views and not all of the children of that view to be configurable.
    While this setting might be rarely needed, it can help restrict

    <P>The composite has two views, one of which is
    shown, along with a single subtrack belonging to that view.
    Notice that the view does not participate in the dimensions
    setting, as it is an implicit dimension controlled by a row of
    visibility dialogs at the top of the composite configuration page.
    Notice that the view does participate in the sortOrder setting
    like other subgroups.  In this example, the peaks view contains
    bigBed subtracks that all share the scoreFilter defaults
    defined at the view level.  Almost any setting that is common to
    the whole tree can be defined at the composite level; any setting
    that is common to the view can be set at the view level; and any
    setting that is specific to one subtrack should be set at that
    level.  Remembering <A href='#inheritance'>inheritance</A>, we 
    can see that the subtrack shown inherits its track type from
    the view, but has its default visibility limited by the composite.
    That is, it inherits packed visibility from the view but the
    composite will show all visible subtracks as dense.</P>

    <P>One additional thing to note is that this composite track is
    "<code>type bed 3</code>".  Composites do not need a type to define 
    their data format, since all data is associated with subtracks. Further, 
    multi-view composites almost always have multiple data formats.  
    But the "type" also controls what configuration options may be offered 
    for a track.  Typically, a single level composite has the same type as 
    all of its subtracks and offers user configuration options at the top 
    level. But a multi-view composite is most often given the bare-bones 
    "<code>type bed 3</code>", and offers user configuration options at 
    the view level.  Exceptions to this pattern do exist but they are rare.</P>

<DIV class="container_intro">
<H3>Aggregate or Overlay Tracks: multiWig</H3>
    <P>In some instances, data from multiple tracks is so closely
    related that it makes sense to view it as a single track.  The
    premiere example of this is the signal overlay
    track (i.e. "<code>multiWig</code>").  Signal overlay tracks display the signal
    data from several subtracks as colored transparencies, making it
    possible to see the data of several tracks together in a condensed
    view.  The value of the overlay track surpasses simply condensing the
    image.  Occasionally this is the most effective way to identify
    hidden relationships in the underlying data.  The overlay track
    should not be overused, however.  Attempts to overlay too many
    subtracks can hide important information as regions with many layered
    signals become too dark to interpret.  More than eight subtracks in a
    single overlay may prove less than ideal.  As with composites,
    it is important for the multiWig tracks to have the same data dimensions, 
    i.e. a signal height of 100 should be interpretable in the same
    way for the whole set of tracks.  While this is true for a composite
    or view, it is especially important for overlay tracks.  You cannot
    reasonably overlay a signal from 0-1 with another signal from 0-1000.</P>
</DIV>

<DIV class="container"><span class="types container multiWig"></span>
<div class="format"><code>container multiWig</code></div>
    <P>Signal overlay tracks are declared much like
    simple composites.  However, instead of a "composite"
    setting, they declare themselves as a "container" of
    "<code>type multiWig</code>".  Like simple composites, all subtrack
    types should be identical and the container itself should be
    declared as the same type (e.g. "<code>bigWig</code>").  Also like a composite,
    the container parent should have common settings for all children.
    Unlike composites, containers can have neither subgroups nor
    views.  Additionally, all subtracks within a container are configured as one; 
    there is no independent configuration of individual subtracks.  Even when the user
    sets the overlay method to none and the subtracks are viewed as
    separate signals, they are still configured as a set.</P>

    <P>This container is for a transparent overlay of
    signal tracks with 2 subtracks shown.  The tracks are
    of type "<code>bigWig</code>", though the first subtrack is a <code>wig</code>.
    Such mixtures are allowed.  Notice that the wig has a slightly
    larger range than the others.  The signal dimensions are close
    enough in this case, and the default viewLimit applied to all
    subtracks suggests that any signal above 10 is interpreted as
    strong. Note that each subtrack must define its color, and
    in this example, that color will be seen in the track
    configuration page as well as in the image.  Also notice that the
    first subtrack declares a table as distinct from its track name.
    Usually the table (or remote file root) name is the same as the
    track name.  The track name is a unique key.  But it is frequently
    the case that a table or remote data file may be displayed as an
    individual track or subtrack, as well  as part of a signal overlay
    track.  Setting the table name here suggests that a track named
    "myFirstWig" also exists and is displaying the same data used in
    this overlay track.</P>

<H3>Custom Tracks</H3>
    <P><I>NOT FOR HUBS.</I></P>
    <P>Custom tracks are
    tracks that get loaded into the Browser through the hgCustom CGI.
    Unlike locally hosted tracks, or even Data Hub tracks, they do not
    have a trackDb.ra  stanza to define their format and behavior in the
    Browser.   Nevertheless, they will support most of the settings as a
    locally hosted track of the same type.  There are a few additional
    settings that are needed to fully support custom tracks.</P>
